# Session 4: Conclusion

In preparation of the last session, we added some styles to give the app some flair, as well some simple persistance using local storage.

Before the demo started, we also did some cleanup and managed to fix a nasty bug that caused incorrect rendering when using an element with adjacent plain text.

We think the result looks great!

To sum up, developing this small framework was a great experience. While it may not be something that we can recommend for use in production, we touched many important topics and learned plenty of new things.
